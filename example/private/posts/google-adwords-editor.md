Today I realized that I've wasted all the monthly budget in one week because of my bad campaign management. 
I did a little search over the Internet because I couldn't find a way to **more** an 'Ad group' from a 
'Campaign' to another and I hit the jackpot. I've stumbled over [Google AdWords Editor](http://www.google.com/intl/en/adwordseditor/) (~21 Mb).

Google AdWords Editor is good for:

*   drag-n-drop actions
*   make offline modifications and the post them online
*   mass/bulk actions

This powerful tool is free and available for both Windows and Mac.
