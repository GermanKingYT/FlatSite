<p>SugarCRM 6 was <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100413005685&amp;newsLang=en">announced</a> on April 13th, 2010 as a way of celebrating the 5th anniversary of SugarForge and the SugarCRM OpenSource Community.</p> <p>Here are some of the coolest features i've noticed in the SugarCRM 6 presentation video:</p>  <p><strong>1.</strong> New top shortcut bar which enables you to rapidly create new record (based on the selected module) without navigating away from the current page.  This shortcut bar is always on top of the screen even if you scroll through a long record.</p> <p><img width="640" height="29" alt="SugarCRM 6 Shortcut Bar" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/sugarcrm6-top-shortcutbar.jpg" /></p> <p><img width="640" height="380" alt="" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/sugarcrm6-screen5.jpg" /></p>   <p><strong>2.</strong> Main module menu is tight integrated, with minimal actions like Create, View, View Reports, Import and Last viewed.</p>   <p><img width="640" height="36" alt="SugarCRM main module menu" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/sugarcrm6-menu.jpg" /></p>   <p>The 'Last Viewed' feature will shorten the time for the finding a record in SugarCRM.</p>   <p><img width="640" height="313" alt="SugarCRM 6 Module Actions" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/sugarcrm6-screen4.jpg" /></p>   <p><strong>3.</strong> JavaScript/AJAX powered tab system</p>   <p>Users can download plugins (Outlook, Word, Excel) directly from the interface.</p>   <p><img width="640" height="423" alt="" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/sugarcrm6-screen3.png" /></p>   <p><strong>4.</strong> Clean and easy-to-read template, easy-to-read grid system</p>   <p>The grid system was simplified. Basic search was simplified, and you can search only by name. <br />   The <img width="18" height="18" alt="" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/edit-icon.gif" /> <em>Edit</em> icon was moved to the left (next to the record name), and the <em>Additional info</em> icon was moved to the right.</p>   <p><img width="317" height="173" alt="" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/additional-info-icon.jpg" /></p>   <p>Remember the mass update options on the bottom of the grid? <br />   They were removed and relocated to the top of the grid and compacted in a single link called <em>Actions</em> which triggers a dropdown with options such as: Delete, Email, Mass Update, Merge, Add to Target List, Export.</p> <p><img width="640" height="305" alt="" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/sugarcrm6-screen7.jpg" /></p>   <p><strong>5.</strong> Global Search was highly improved! <br />     This is a great time saver. It appears you don't have to enter % anymore to find the partial results;    the results are displayed instantly in a dropdown.</p>  <p><img width="386" height="667" alt="SugarCRM 6 Global Search" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/sugarcrm6-global-search.jpg" /></p> <p><strong>6.</strong> The 'Detail View' was modified so everything is grouped. <br /> This is something already existing in SugarCRM 5.x but the design now clearly delimitates these sections and makes them easier to read.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here is the official video from the SugarCRM 6 UI Preview:</p>   <object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5OqBKXvwcO0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999&amp;hd=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed width="640" height="505" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5OqBKXvwcO0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>    <p>Other SugarCRM 6 related resources:</p> <ul>   <li>You can <a href="http://www.sugarforge.org/content/downloads/">download SugarCRM Community Edition 6</a> (beta for the moment).</li>   <li>Read the official press release <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100413005685&amp;newsLang=en">SugarCRM Announces New User Interface, Enhanced Features with Beta Release of Sugar 6</a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/products/new-in-sugar.html">What's new in Sugar</a> - from SugarCRM.com.
