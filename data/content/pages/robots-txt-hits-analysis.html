<p>During April 1st until May 26th (+ few hours from May 27th) period i ran a test over one of my website's <em>robots.txt</em> file, counting all the external hits.</p> <p>Before we go any further you must take the following data into account:</p> <p>- in April the site had 100.000+ unique links reported in Google's index, about 2000+ in Yahoo's index<br />   - in May the site had 40.000 unique links reported in Google's  index, and about 58.000 in Yahoo's index<br />  - there were some significant changes made to the site: the access was restricted to pages generated by filters (see my previous article - <a href="/search-engines-dynamic-content-issues.html">Search engines and dynamic content issues</a>), at the end of the period the navigation menu changed, there were 2 or 3 days near the end of the period when the <em>robots.txt</em> file was blank or showing some errors.<br /> - the Google Webmasters Tools interface reported: 240.000+ pages restricted by <em>robots.txt</em>, the Crawl Speed was automatically set from Faster to Normal (I don't have the option for Faster activated any more).</p> <p><a href="/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/robots_txt_hits_27.05.07.gif"><img width="138" hspace="5" height="194" border="0" align="left" alt="" src="http://2k.serbanghita.com/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/studiu_robotstxt_small.gif" /></a>If we take a look at  the complete User-Agent <a href="/robotstxt-hits-analysis-report.html">list with crawlers that have hit the robots.txt</a> file, we notice that we have the top 5 seats taken by: Slurp, Googlebot, Gigabot, msnbot and Ask Jeeves/Teoma. A complete surprise is the 3rd position in which is situated <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/spider.html" rel="nofollow external">Gigabot crawler</a> , because the site I'm talking about is merely getting any hits from gigablast.com. Also Gigablast.com reports mostly 1 year old pages when i search the site URL in their index (about 19.000 pages).</p> <p>The Gigabot spider has 5 different User-Agent signatures:</p> <ul style="display: block; float: left; list-style-type: square;">   <li>Gigabot/1.0</li>   <li>Gigabot/2.0</li>   <li>Gigabot/2.0 (http://www.gigablast.com/spider.html)</li>   <li>Gigabot/2.0/gigablast.com/spider.html</li>   <li>Gigabot/2.0att</li> </ul> <p style="clear: left;">The uncontested winner of this study is Yahoo's Slurp crawler which hit the robots.txt file 3405 times in 57 days (taking in account May 27th - the day just started) resulting an astonishing 59.7 <em>robots.txt</em> hits per day. As you can see from <a href="/template/docs/content/12/robots_txt_hits_27.05.07.gif">the graphic</a> , there were days when Slurp passed <strong>250 hits</strong> per day. Those were the days when i heavely edited the <em>robots.txt</em> file (you can also see Google reacting later). I noticed that when you make some significant changes in your <em>robots.txt</em> file, the crawlers tend to revisit it after a short time, because of obvious reasons: saves them and us bandwidth (e.g. maybe you've just restricted some areas of the site, the sooner the crawlers find out, the better for your server's bandwidth)</p> <p style="clear: left;">At the end of the period (as you can see from the graphic), i've messed the <em>robots.txt</em> a little bit - it was blank or showing some code errors for 2-3 days. This is because i have made some changes in the site's code, and my <em>robots.txt</em> is dynamic (relies on some classes). Yahoo's Slurp crawler reacted at this by increasing the hit rate.</p> <p style="clear: left;">Googlebot tends to have a constant hit rate at about 24-25 hits per day in this case.</p> <p style="clear: left;">The Yahoo Feedseeker bot has a constant 1 hit per day. They also have a test bot (<em>YahooFeedSeeker    Testing/2.0 (compatible; Mozilla 4.0; MSIE 5.5;    http://publisher.yahoo.com/rssguide)</em>), for the next version which produces a couple of hits.</p> <p style="clear: left;">I couldn't stop msn-media bot  from indexing my site even if i had the following code in <em>robots.txt</em>:</p> <p style="clear: left;">User-agent: MSNBot-Media<br /> Disallow: /</p> <p style="clear: left;">I remember taking this from a huge corporation site, which had these lines in their <em>robots.txt</em> code, i will try using <em>User-agent: msnbot-media/1.0</em> in the future. By the way, do not copy-paste code from other sites, they might be wrong about the standards. Take New York Times for example:</p> <p style="clear: left;">User-agent: Mediapartners-Google*  <br /> Disallow:</p> <p style="clear: left;">From my knowledge of the robots.txt standard the * character is not allowed in the User-agent: [...] syntax. Also the line with Disallow: actually allows the bot to index the pages.</p> <p style="clear: left;">Summary:</p> <p style="clear: left;">- <a href="/robotstxt-hits-analysis-report.html">robots.txt hits</a> from April 1st - May 26 (+ few hours from 27) <br /> - <a href="/template/docs/content/12/robots_txt_hits_27.05.07.gif">robots.txt hits graphic</a> <br /> - <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html" rel="external">robots.txt standard </a><br /> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt" rel="external">about robots.txt</a> on Wikipedia</p>
