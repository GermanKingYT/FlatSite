          It's been a while since I've created my first personal HTML page hosted at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">
            Geocities
          </a>
          . Even now after more than one decade I still have the same passion and excitement when creating a new script or web application.

          Here is a brief history of what I've been working on in the past:

          <b>
            2002
          </b>
          - I got hired in a small local computer retail company (
          <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.stonet.ro/">
            Stonet Computers
          </a>
          Craiova). During this time I got over excited with open-source ecommerce scripts, most notably
          <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.oscommerce.com/">
            osCommerce
          </a>
          for which I contributed with one module. In the same period of time I founded
          <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fastweb.ro/">
            Fastweb Romania
          </a>
          inside the mother company and remotely collaborated with Linux Magazin until 2005. At Linux Magazin Romania I acted as a webmaster and I also wrote an article called &quot;
          <em>
            Inside Distrowatch.com
          </em>
          &quot; about the insights of the website.

          <b>
            2004
          </b>
          - I moved to
          <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.itpromo.ro/">
            VERASYS International
          </a>
          another local computer retail company which was offering much more opportunities I desired. In 2005 I've assembled a team of web developers working for external clients of the company. In 2006 I've founded www.itpromo.ro an ecommerce store primarily for Small &amp; Medium Businesses. During my period at VERASYS I worked at every aspects of the business from Web Development to Business Development.
