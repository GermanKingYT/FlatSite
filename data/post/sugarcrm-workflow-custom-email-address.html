<p>If you are using the 'Workflow Management' feature in SugarCRM you probably already created some basic workflows and ran into the following question: How do include <strong>a custom email address</strong> in the '<em>Alert recipients</em>' list?</p><p>Here how you get the job done, in my case i am using Opportunities module as an example.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Go to Admin &gt; User Management.</p><p><a href="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/Untitled-1.png"><img align="left" style="margin-right:10px;border:0;" alt="" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/articles_imgs/Untitled-1.png" /></a>Hover with the mouse over the top menu bar in the 'Users' section and click <strong>Create Group User</strong>&nbsp;(<em>/index.php?module=Users&amp;action=EditView&amp;usertype=group&amp;return_module=Users&amp;return_action=DetailView</em>). Fill the mandatory fields: User Name, Name, Status = Active, Email address</p><p>What is a Group User?</p><p><a href="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/articles_imgs/Untitled-2.png"><img style="margin-left:10px;border:0;" align="right" alt="" src="http://ghita.org/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/articles_imgs/Untitled-2.png" /></a>According the the Users -&gt; <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/support/documentation/SugarProfessional/6.0/-docs-Application_Guides-Sugar_Professional_Application_Guide_6.0GA-Administration.html#1916499">User management section</a> in the SugarCRM Pro Documentation &quot;<em>a Group User is a bucket that is used for inbound emails, and <strong>does not count</strong> toward the number of Sugar licenses that you purchase for your organization. For example, creating a group mail account for Support creates a group user named Support to handle customer&nbsp;support issues.</em>&quot;</p><p>In my case i've created a Sales.Test user which in a real world case scenario would represent a general email address like sales@your-company.com, so everytime i change something in an Opportunity the whole sales department would know about it.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Next go to Admin -&gt; Workflow Management -&gt; Create Workflow Definition</p><p>I've created a workflow called &nbsp;'Reassign Opportunity' which states that when an opportunity is reassigned to another user, he will be notified but i want also to notify the Sales.Test email address i've just created.</p><p>Go to Alerts -&gt; Recipients, click 'Create' button, check 'All users in a specified team', click on the 'Team' link below and select 'Sales.Test', and put it to To: or&nbsp;CC:.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Save, go to Opportunity and reassign an Opportunity and you will receive an email on both the currently assigned user and on Sales.Test email address. That's it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don't necessary have to have a registered user to be able to send a workflow email to a certain email address, you can do it with 'Group User' feature described at the top.</p>
