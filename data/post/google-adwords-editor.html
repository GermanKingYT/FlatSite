<p>Today I realized that I've wasted all the monthly budget in one week because of my bad campaign management. I did a little search over the Internet because I couldn't find a way to <b>more</b> an 'Ad group' from a 'Campaign' to another and I hit the jackpot. I've stumbled over <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/adwordseditor/">Google AdWords Editor</a> (~21 Mb).</p>

<p>Google AdWords Editor is good for:</p>
<ul>
 <li>drag-n-drop actions</li>
<li>make offline modifications and the post them online</li>
<li>mass/bulk actions</li>
</ul>

<p>This powerful tool is free and available for both Windows and Mac.</p>
