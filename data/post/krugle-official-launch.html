<p>On June 14th Krugle - find code, find answers -(<a href="http://www.krugle.com">www.krugle.com</a>) went live after a period of beta-testing. During this period they've received over 4700 pieces of feedback.</p>

<p>Krugle helps you find the code you need and the related technical and   licensing information to evaluate and use that code. And once you&rsquo;ve found what   you need, Krugle lets you save it and share it. The process of searching,   evaluating and communicating are dramatically faster with Krugle. Krugle was designed by programmers, for programmers. As a result, it is much   more than just a search engine for code. It&rsquo;s a powerful tool designed to   provide the critical information software developers need.</p> <p>The staff has some <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=293302190793">contest</a> going on in this period, and you should also check out their <a href="http://blog.krugle.com/">blog</a>, to see the latest development news.</p>
